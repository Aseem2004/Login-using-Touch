# Login With Touch 
This repo contains a project through which you can log in using the touch of your finger. <br>
The page itself doesn't log in to some other webpage or link but you can see a green tick mark and a written 'SUCCESS' statement which ensures that the scan of your finger was successful and the user has passed the log in.
