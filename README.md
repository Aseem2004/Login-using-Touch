# Login With Touch 
This repo contains a project through which you can log in using the touch of your finger. <br>
The page itself doesn't log in to some other webpage or link but you can see a green tick mark and a written 'SUCCESS' monosyllable which ensures that the scan of your finger was successful and the user has passed the log in. <br>
You have to hold the finger for a bit after clicking the fingerprint icon before the 'Success' monosyllable comes on. <br>
This is a responsive web page, so you can use this on any device you like. The device on which physical touch with a finger is not possible, you click and hold with the cursor of the device to obtain the same result. <br> <br>
Hope you liked it <br>
<b>Thank You</b>
